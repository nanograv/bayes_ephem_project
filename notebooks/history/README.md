# A list of historical (now abandoned) BayesEphem notebooks

* bayes_ephem.ipynb - Early attempts at implementing BayesEphem in Enterprise
* dynamic_partial_tests.ipynb - More Enterprise development, especially 
* Experiments-with-Joe.ipynb - A lot of the work covered in BayesEphem.ipynb, including the development of the SS integrator, a study of the effects of changing masses, an analysis of DE differences as explained by the initial conditions of various bodies, making dynamical partials, a study of posteriors in preliminary runs,  
* INPOP-ephemerides.ipynb - A brief study of INPOP partials and covariance (files included in INPOP_partials)
* inpop_partial_tests.ipynb - Using INPOP in Enterprise
* mvallis_physicalmodel.ipynb - Development of "orbel" partials (buggy, see BayesEphem.ipynb), and an early look at recovered covariance matrices.
