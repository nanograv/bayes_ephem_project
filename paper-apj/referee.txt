We thank the referee for their kind remarks and useful suggestions.

Good suggestion! Now “...this degeneracy will vanish with improved ephemerides
and with pulsar-timing datasets that extend well beyond a single Jovian orbital
period.”

Sure. Perhaps “first hand” is even better here.

We use it to mean “namely”, but in case neither instance is needed.

In fact linear dependencies will always be absorbed, but Uranus and Neptune
won’t always generate linear corrections. Therefore we changed this to "We do
not include Uranus and Neptune's orbital perturbations, which currently lead to
$\delta t_{\mathrm{R\odot}}$ with linear time dependencies that are absorbed
entirely by timing-model parameters."

OK!

How about “that includes their rates”?

Fine! But then the phrase sits better in the next paragraph.

We would say that the confusion (in a measurement sense) among different
multipoles is not so much due to the short timespan, but to the limited number
of good pulsars in the dataset. We make this point later in Sec. 6:

"While SSE corrections and the GWB have different spatial-correlation
"structures, the two may nevertheless remain degenerate when probed by a limited
"number of PTA pulsars (Roebber 2019).”

The link to the evolving timespan is due to the fact that a dipolar signal
(Jupiter) moves away from the frequency of highest GW sensitivity, and that more
“new” pulsars appear in the dataset with timespans of statistical significance.

Nevertheless, it may be good to reiterate the point in the introduction.

Thank you!
